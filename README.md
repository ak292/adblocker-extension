# AdBlocker Chrome Extension in TypeScript

This is an Adblocker Chrome Extension written in TypeScript which makes use of Manifest V3 (Declarative Net Request API as opposed to the WebRequest API of Manifest V2).

It is not a production ready AdBlocker, it was done for educational purposes and makes use of the Declarative Net Request API to block a few simple common Google Ad servers.

### How to Run

This was not published to the Google Chrome store as it was meant to be just for educational purposes, but if you want to test it out, you need to:

1. Open Google Chrome and go to chrome://extensions
2. Make sure you have Developer mode toggled on.
3. In the upper right corner, click on "Load Unpacked" and select the dist folder (that you can download as a ZIP from GitHub)
